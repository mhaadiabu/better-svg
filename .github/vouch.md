# Contributor trust

We use [Vouch](https://github.com/mitchellh/vouch) to record trusted contributors in
[VOUCHED.td](VOUCHED.td). This initial list includes the repository's current contributors.
Leaving someone off the list means they are unvouched. It does not denounce them.

mhaadiabu can vouch, unvouch, and denounce contributors.
[VOUCHED-MANAGERS.td](VOUCHED-MANAGERS.td) records this permission for all three actions.

Run the **Manage contributor trust** workflow with an action, a GitHub username, and a reason.
It reads the maintainer list from `main` and opens the change as a PR against `main`.
Review and merge that PR manually. The workflow does not merge PRs.
GitHub requires this workflow on the default branch before it appears in the Actions menu.

Changes to either trust list should also target `main` when submitted manually.

## Trust labels

`pr-vouch.yml` labels open pull requests and `issue-vouch.yml` labels open
issues with one of `vouch:trusted`, `vouch:unvouched`, or `vouch:denounced`,
based on the author's status in `VOUCHED.td`. Collaborators with write access
and bots count as trusted without a list entry. Labels refresh when PRs and
issues open or change, when `VOUCHED.td` changes on `main`, and when
someone comments `/recheck-vouch`.

This setup records trust and surfaces it as labels. It does not automatically
close or lock issues or PRs from unvouched contributors.
